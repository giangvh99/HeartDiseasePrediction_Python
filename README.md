# HeartDiseasePrediction_Python
## Heart disease prediction using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting
### About this project
This project focuses on analyzing cardiovascular disease data, using a multivariate dataset containing 14 patient-related attributes. The main goal of the study is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on attributes such as age, gender, type of chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, and several other indicators.

Key research issues include:

●	Predicting heart disease: Using patient attributes to determine the likelihood of having heart disease.

●	Data analysis: Discovering and analyzing factors that influence heart disease, thereby drawing valuable insights.

●	Medical applications: Providing information to help doctors and researchers better understand heart disease, thereby improving diagnosis and treatment.
